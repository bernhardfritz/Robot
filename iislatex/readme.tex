\section{Introduction}

Your document should begin with an introduction.

\section{Technical Content}

This is the bulk of your report, one or more sections, with nice illustrations. It is good style to cite people, not publications, as recommends \cite{Piater-2011-IISreport}. Web references should be avoided to the extent possible because they cannot usually be considered \emph{archival} \citep{Wikipedia-Archive}, and require careful assessment of reliability.

\section{Conclusions}

Your document should conclude with a summary of the highlights, and any conclusions to be drawn.
